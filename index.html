    I am a service driven individual, I get gratification from assisting others. I have worked in management in the service industry at a young age, and have learned many lessons in leadership through that role. Additionally, I'm a Private First Class in the North Carolina Army National Guard. My experiences in the guard have granted me with additional lessons in leadership, commitment and hard work. All virtues that I take with me in my everyday life.  
    <br><br><br>
    I have always had an interest in technology and creating experiences for others. I hope to one day take both interest's and incorporate them into a career, whether it be web development or another form of programming. When I'm not working, I enjoy utilizing my free time to go hiking, conduct physical fitness, or just relax and play some video games.
